unsound practice in the conduct of the business of the virtual asset service 
provider, 

the Authority may direct the virtual asset service provider, in relation to the 
virtual asset service, to cease or refrain from carrying out the act or pursuing the 
course of conduct and to carry out such acts as are necessary, in the opinion of 
the Authority, to remedy or ameliorate its conduct.

virtual asset service provider vesting involuntarily or through process of law in 
a person, the company or partnership, as soon as it becomes aware of such 
vesting, shall inform the Authority of the number of shares or interests and the 
identity of the person in whom the shares or interests have vested; and the
