(1) A sandbox licence is a temporary licence granted for a period of up to one year 
and shall be subject to review at such time as the Authority may determine is 
appropriate. 

(2) The Authority shall assess, monitor and supervise the innovative service, 
technology or method of delivery of a sandbox licensee with a view to ensuring 
that — 

 (a) the service, technology or method of delivery complies with the principles 
under section 17;

19. Application for a sandbox licence 

(1) The Authority may require — 

(a) a person applying to be registered or a supervised person; or 
(b) a person applying for a virtual asset service licence or a virtual asset 
service licensee, 

to apply, instead, for a sandbox licence where the Authority determines that — 
  (i) the virtual asset service represents an innovative use of technology 
or uses an innovative method of delivery that requires supervision 
and oversight that is not offered by a licence or registration under this 
Act or any other law; 
  (ii) it is in the best interest of the public, supervised persons, licensees, 
registered persons or the financial markets for the virtual asset 
service to be temporarily restricted or for specific requirements to be 
placed temporarily on the provision of the virtual asset service; 
  (iii) the virtual asset service uses or promotes technology or method of 
delivery that may create systemic risk to the financial markets or 
otherwise to the jurisdiction; or 
  (iv) the virtual asset service poses a money laundering, terrorism 
financing or proliferation financing risk that is not properly mitigated 
by the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (2020 Revision) or this 
Act, 

and the Authority shall cancel the registration or revoke the virtual asset service 
licence where it has required the person to apply for a sandbox licence. 

(2) A person under subsection (1) who has been directed by the Authority to apply 
for a sandbox licence shall do so in the manner specified by the Authority and 
shall provide such additional information in support of that application as the 
Authority may specify. 

(3) A fintech service provider may, but is not required to, apply for a sandbox 
licence in such manner as may be specified by the Authority. 

(4)  a supervised person who has provided notice and has been directed by the 
Authority to apply for a sandbox licence shall do so in the manner specified by 
the Authority. 

(5) An applicant for a sandbox licence shall pay the prescribed assessment fee at 
the time of submission of the application and the application fee as may be 
specified by the Authority within thirty days of notification of approval for a 
licence. 

(6) Where the sandbox application fee remains unpaid within thirty days of 
notification, the Authority shall cancel its approval of the sandbox licence.

support of the application as the Authority may specify.

consideration the fintech service and its probable effects on financial service business.

provider shall comply with all requirements applicable to virtual asset service 
providers in this Act. 

(2) The Authority, where it grants a sandbox licence, may — 

 (a) impose any of the requirements that are applicable to a virtual asset service

fintech service or the virtual asset service be maintained in the Islands to 
facilitate the supervision of the service by the Authority; or

virtual asset service providers or modify any requirement in such manner 
as the Authority considers appropriate; 
(e) require a sandbox licensee who is a virtual asset service provider to comply 
with the requirement under section 31(1), 

and every imposition, exemption or modification by the Authority shall be in 
writing.

under subsection (2), the Authority may impose such conditions that it considers

modification granted under this section and shall notify the sandbox licensee in 
writing of its decision and the reason for its decision. 

(6) Notwithstanding its powers under subsection (2), the Authority may, where it 
has made a determination, take any action necessary, where the Authority is of 
the opinion that the action is necessary for the protection of clients or potential 
clients and in the interest of the public. 

(7) Before taking any such action under subsection (6), the Authority shall notify 
the sandbox licensee, in writing, of the actions to be taken and provide its 
reasons for pursuing such action.

period of twenty-eight days from the date of the receipt of the notice, make 
written representations to the Authority and where such representations are 
made, the Authority shall take them into account in deciding whether to take the 
proposed action but the Authority shall not be prevented from taking action 
before the written representations are made. 

(9) Where a licensed fintech service provider refers to its licence in any material 
that is published, distributed or otherwise made available to the public, the
